0 A.D. is designed to be easily modded. Mods are distributed in the form of .pyromod files, which can be opened like .zip files.

In order to install mods, just open the file with 0 A.D.: it will then be available in the mod selector. You can enable it and disable it at will. You can delete the mod manually using your file browser if needed (see https://trac.wildfiregames.com/wiki/GameDataPaths).

mod.io is a service developed by DBolical that allows us to list and download all the mods that were verified by the team. Click "Download Mods" to try it out and install some!
