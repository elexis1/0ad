0 A.D. Empires Ascendant UserReporter Terms and Conditions

Document Date: 2018-08-12

The 0 A.D. UserReporter is a tool that allows the you, the 0 A.D. player, to automatically upload hardware-, system- and performance statistics in order to help developers improve the performance and compatibility of 0 A.D.

The UserReporter data consists of:
1. Hardware Details, for example the screen size, CPU clock rate, memory capacity and the sound card manufacturer.
2. System Software Details, for example the operating system version, graphics driver version, OpenGL capabilities.
3. Application Details, for example the 0 A.D. version and build number.
4. The UserID. This is a pseudonym generated by the UserReporter the first time it is used.
  It enables the developers to count how many 0 A.D. players use a specific set of hardware or system software.

If the UserReporter is enabled, this data is uploaded once per program launch.

Wildfire Games reserves the right to:
 1. Publish UserReport data, excluding the UserID and IP address.
  At the time of the document creation, Wildfire Games published the most recent UserReporter analysis at http://feedback.wildfiregames.com/.
 2. Erase any data for any reason.
 3. Store the IP address for no longer than 3 months in a separate logfile to avert cyberattacks.
